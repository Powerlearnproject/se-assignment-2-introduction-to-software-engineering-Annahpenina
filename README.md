# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:

It is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools for the development and maintenance of high quality software systems.

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?

software engineering is building, designing software systems. traditional programming focus more narrowly on coding tasks while software engineering accentuate a holistic aproach to software development.

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Agile     : incremental approach focused on flexibility, responding to change and collaboration
Waterfall : it has a sequential approach with distict phases such as requirements, design e.t.c


Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?

Planning
Agile - it is a continuous process throughout the projects  life cycle with adjustments taken as new         information or requirements.
Waterfall - it is a linear process done at the very begining of tthe project with objectives laid out in detail.

Delivery
Agile : allows fast delivery of projects with shorter life cycles.
waterfall : requires the completion of all tasks before any work can be released.

Flexibility
Agile : responds quickly and adaptively to changes during  the development process.
Waterfall : is less flexible and resistant to change once the projects scope has been defined

Agile is preferred over waterfal.

Requirements Engineering:



What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Software Design Principles:

Requirements engineering is gathering and documenting user need and system requirement.

Elicitation: This involves gathering requirements from relevant parties. Techniques such as interviews, survays, observation e.t.c are often used to understand their needs and expectations.

Analysis: when requirements are gathered, they need to be analyzed to know they are complete, consistent, clear e.t.c. This involves identifying stakeholders' priorities, resolving conflicts, and refining requirements to make them more precise and actionable.

Documentation: After analysis, requirements are documented in a formal manner thus serves as a reference for all project stakeholders, including developers, testers, and project managers. 

Validation: it is to ensures that the documented requirements accurately represent stakeholders' needs and expectations. Techniques such as reviews, walkthroughs, and prototyping are used to validate requirements before proceeding to the next phases of development.

Management: Requirements are subject to change throughout the software development lifecycle due to evolving business needs, technological advancements, and other factors. Therefore, it's essential to manage requirements effectively by establishing a change control process and maintaining traceability between requirements and other project artifacts.

Requirements engineering is a critical phase in software development, laying the groundwork for successful project delivery by ensuring that the developed software meets stakeholders' needs, is delivered on time, and within budget.

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?

It is aimed at creating software in a way that minimizes dependencies among the components of a system thus simplifies maintenance and enhances the understandability of the system.

Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?

Unit testing - testing individual components or modules of software
Integrated testing - testing interactions between different components
System testing - testing the entire software as a whole
Acceptance testing - testing the software against the user requirements to ensure it meets user needs
 Its critical aspect of quality assurance and involves various types of tests.


Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.

Are software tools for tracking changes to sourse code and coordinating work amoung team members.
They are important because software engineering tools enhance productivity, coding quality and collaboration by providing developers with feature such as code editors, version control debugging tools.

Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?

A software project manager takes the overall responsibility to manage the software projects and the successful completion of the project, they take the responsibility of writing the project proposal, project cost estimation, software process tailoring and project monitoring.
they face many challenges in their roles such as scope creep, budgetin issues, risk Management foreseeing potentialpossible risks to the project, team collaboration, communication, lack of communication may result in inefficient work and undiscovered project loopholes.

Software Maintenance:


Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?

It is the process of updating, modifying, and enhancing existing software applications after they have been deployed thus it It encompasses a variety of activities aimed at ensuring that software remains functional and secure.
Corrective maintenance : it aims to identify and fix bugs that affect the functionality, reliability, or security of the software after it has been deployed.

Perfective maintenance : the objective is to enhance the software's value and user experience over time based on user feedback or evolving requirements.

Routine maintenance : helps prevent system failures, data loss, and security breaches by keeping the software and its underlying infrastructure up-to-date and properly maintained by doing software updates, data backups, system monitoring, and server maintenance.



Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?

Security Vulnerabilities: arise when software engineers discover security vulnerabilities or weeknesses thus  prioritize security over time-to-market pressures, and ensure the safety of end-users.

Bias and Fairness: issues of bias and fairness in algorithmic decision-making systems such as addressing biases in data sets, ensuring fairness in algorithmic outcomes, and reduce the potential for discrimination.

Open Source Contributions: when contributing to open-source projects, such as ensuring proper attribution, respecting licensing agreements, and contributing to projects that align with ethical values and goals.

Adhere to ethical standards in their work:
Ethical Decision-Making Frameworks: which are IEEE Code of Ethics or the ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct, to guide your decision-making process when faced with ethical problems.

Education and Awareness: be informed about ethical issues and best practices in software engineering through continuous learning, professional development, and participation in ethical discussions and communities.

Submission Guidelines:
Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
Submit your completed assignment by [due date].
